 
# Modern Token

**Modern Token** is an open-source platform built on blockchain technology that allows users to discuss and vote on various topics, earn rewards, and participate in platform governance. The platform revolves around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) associated with the URLs or topics being discussed, enabling users to create, trade, and participate in topic-based NFTs while earning rewards in the platform's native tokens.

## Features
- **NFT-based topics**: Users can create or engage in discussions tied to NFTs, representing ownership over certain topics.
- **Marketplace**: Buy and sell topic-associated NFTs on the platform's marketplace.
- **Rewards**: Users earn rewards for participation in discussions, voting, and platform governance through the native token system.
- **Governance**: Token holders participate in the governance and decision-making processes of the platform.
- **Chat Platform**: Ownership of a topic NFT gives access to a chat space where users can discuss, comment, and share information related to the topic.
